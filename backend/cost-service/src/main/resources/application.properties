# ============================================
# COST SERVICE CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# This file tells Spring Boot how to run your application
# Think of it as the "settings" or "preferences" for your app

# ============================================
# 1. APPLICATION NAME
# ============================================
# What is this service called? This name appears in logs and monitoring tools
# Helps identify this specific microservice when you have multiple services running
spring.application.name=cost-service

# ============================================
# 2. DATABASE CONNECTION (PostgreSQL)
# ============================================
# These settings tell your Java app HOW to connect to the PostgreSQL database
# Think of it like WiFi settings - you need the address, username, and password

# Database URL - Where is the database located?
# Format: jdbc:postgresql://[host]:[port]/[database-name]
# localhost:5432 = database is running on your computer on port 5432
# finops_db = the name of the database we want to connect to
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5433/finops_db

# Database Username - Who are you logging in as?
spring.datasource.username=finops_user

# Database Password - What's the password for that user?
spring.datasource.password=finops_password

# Database Driver - Which "translator" to use for PostgreSQL
# This is the software library that knows how to speak to PostgreSQL
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver

# ============================================
# 3. JPA/HIBERNATE CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# JPA = Java Persistence API (saves Java objects to database)
# Hibernate = The tool that does the actual work of converting Java objects to SQL

# DDL Auto - Should Hibernate create/update database tables automatically?
# Options:
#   - create: Delete everything and create fresh tables each time (DANGEROUS!)
#   - create-drop: Create tables, then delete when app stops (for testing)
#   - update: Update tables if your Java classes change (GOOD for development)
#   - validate: Just check if tables match, don't change anything (SAFE for production)
#   - none: Do nothing
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

# Show SQL - Should we print SQL queries to the console?
# Very helpful for learning and debugging! You can see what queries are running
spring.jpa.show-sql=true

# Hibernate Dialect - Tell Hibernate we're using PostgreSQL
# Different databases (MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL) have slightly different SQL syntax
# This tells Hibernate to use PostgreSQL-specific features and syntax
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgreSQLDialect

# Format SQL - Make the SQL queries pretty and readable in logs
# Without this, SQL appears on one long line - hard to read!
spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true

# ============================================
# 4. SERVER CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# Which port should this service listen on?
# Default is 8080, but we use 8082 to avoid conflicts with other services
# You'll access this service at: http://localhost:8082
server.port=8082

# ============================================
# 5. LOGGING CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# How much information should we print to the console?
# Levels: TRACE < DEBUG < INFO < WARN < ERROR
# Lower levels = more detailed output

# Log everything from our cost service code in DEBUG mode (very detailed)
logging.level.finops.cost_service=DEBUG
logging.level.org.springframework.web=INFO

# Log all SQL statements from Hibernate in DEBUG mode
# This shows you every database query that runs
logging.level.org.hibernate.SQL=DEBUG

# Optional: Show the values being used in SQL queries (very useful for debugging)
# Uncomment the line below to see parameter values in your SQL queries
# logging.level.org.hibernate.type.descriptor.sql.BasicBinder=TRACE

# ============================================
# 6. ACTUATOR CONFIGURATION
# ============================================
# Spring Boot Actuator provides health checks and monitoring endpoints
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=health,info,metrics
management.endpoint.health.show-details=always
